# Virtual Anaglyph Glasses

This mini-project demonstrates creating a simple web application that uses the webcam to view anaglyph 3D imagery. 
This is useful in the case that you forgot to carry an anaglyph glass.

Anaglyph 3D combines two images (usually red and green) to create a stereoscopic 3D effect when viewed with 3D glasses.

To view, just place your smartphone in either a smartphone to VR headset adaptor... 
or use your hand between the two video feeds to help your eyes focus on each image.

This uses your webcam.
